\chapter{Introduction}
Most computers, including smartphones have their internal clocks to keep track
of time. Different accuracies are required for different purposes. 
For example, if someone needs to join a conference on time, and she can
only get the current time from her computer. If the system time of the
computer is a few minutes off, compared with the ``correct'' time, it may be
acceptable. But if the offset amount is one hour, she will be there either too
early and have to wait for one hour or too late and the conference may be over
at that time.

In some other cases, a very high accuracy of system time is required. For
example, there is a system handles stock market buy and sell orders. Generally,
more than one devices are there in the system. So that the system times among
devices should be ``the same'' since we need to know the order of the orders at
least. If the system is very busy and thousands orders may be created in one
second, every device should have system time accurate to millisecond at least.

As we can see in the previous example, only a ``local accuracy'' is required,
which means that every devices in the system need to synchronize its system
time to the same reference clock. If the reference clock is in an internal
device, they do not have to be synchronized to external devices. In some other
cases, a device may need to be synchronized to a standard time, such as UTC
(Coordinated Universal Time).  

An easy way of synchronizing a clock is to ask someone else for the time, and
then adjusting the system clock manually. We always adjust the time of our
watches like that. This level of  accuracy is quite enough if we do not need
our watches accurate to the second. 

What about to imply this method on synchronizing computers system clock? Assume
computer A wants to synchronize to computer B, A can send a message to B then B
checks its time and replies to A\null. Then A can adjust its system time.  
But there are a lot of problems.  The core one is that when A receives
the time, it can only know the time was when B checked its time. A cannot know
how long it is from then to when A receives the message. To solve these
problems, the network time protocol (NTP) is developed for devices to
synchronize their system times over networks. 

\section{Computers' Clocks}
\label{sec:computers_clocks}
Different computers may use different hardware methods to maintain system time.
It relates to hardware architecture and operating system design. But they have
the same fundamental idea: increasing a counter with a ``constant'' frequency,
such as 1 GHz.
Based on the frequency and the counter, the system time can be calculated
when necessary. But in practice, the frequency is not constant. First of all,
there may be some manufacturing error, which makes it slightly different from
what it should be. Second, the frequency can be affected by temperature,
humidity and so on. So the system clock can be very inaccurate if it has not
been synchronized for quite a long time, and the offset is unpredictable.

\section{Trend}
\label{sec:trend}
The performance of time synchronization is affected by the hardware
performance, the quality of network connection and the synchronization protocol
itself. 
As we have faster internet connections, and more powerful CPUs, we have better
opportunity to more accurately set system clocks. As we have more accurate
system clocks, we can do more real-time stuff on internet. As we do more
real-time stuff on internet, we desire more accurate system clock. We always
want to make system clocks as accurate as possible after the improvements of
internet connection and CPUs. 

In real life, atomic clocks are considered the most accurate. In 2015 the most
accurate atomic clock is accurate to $2.1\times 10^{-18}$
second.~\cite{atomic_clock}

This accuracy is far beyond the timekeeping ability of current general-purpose
computers to maintain, and beyong the current ability of networks to accurately
transmit the time from an atomic clock to a distant computer. With this fact,
we can always improve the performance of time synchronization after we
significantly improve hardware or network connection.
