\chapter{Introduction}
Most computers and smartphones has their system times. Different accuracies are
required for different purposes. 
Assume that there is someone need to join a conference on time, and she can
only get time from her computer. If there the system time of the computer is
few minutes off compare with ``correct'' time, it is acceptable. But if the
offset amount is one hour, she will be there either too early and have to
wait for one hour or too late and the conference may be over at that time.

In some other cases, a very high accuracy of system time is required. For
example, there is a system handles stock market buy and sell orders. Generally,
more than one devices are there in the system. So that the system times among
devices should be ``the same'' since we need to know the order of the orders at
least. If the system is very busy and thousands orders may be created in one
second, every device should have system time accurate to millisecond at least.

As we can see in the previous example, only a ``local accuracy'' is required,
which means that every devices in the system need to synchronize its system
time to the same reference clock. If the reference clock is in an internal
device, they do not have to be synchronized to external devices. In some other
cases, a device may need to be synchronized to a standard time, such as UTC
(Coordinated Universal Time).  

The easy way of synchronizing clock is to ask someone else the time, and
adjust system clock manually. We always adjust the time of our
watches like that. The accuracy is quite enough if we do not need out watches
accurate to second. 

What about to imply this method on synchronizing computers system clock? Assume
computer A wants to synchronize to computer B, A can send a message to B then B
checks its time and replies to A. So A can adjust its system time.  
Obviously, there are a lot of problems.  The core one is that when A receive
the time, it can only know the time is when B checks its time. A cannot know
how long it is from then to when A receives the message. To solve these
problems, the network time protocol (NTP) is developed for devices to
synchronize their system times through network.
