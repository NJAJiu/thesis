\chapter{Overview}
NTP operates on three different kinds of devices: primary servers, secondary
servers and clients. Primary servers are directly synchronized to reference
clocks and provide service that other devices can synchronize to them.
Secondary severs are synchronized to other servers instead of reference clocks
and provide synchronization service. Clients are synchronized to other servers
but they do not provide synchronization to others.
