\section{Concepts}%
\label{sec:peer/poll_concepts}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Offset $\theta$\\
        The maximum-likelihood time offset of the server clock relative to the
        system clock. This concept describes how different the client's time
        and the server's time are.
        % $$\theta_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(T_{i-2} - T_{i-3}\right) +
        % \left(T_{i-1} - T_i\right)\right]$$
    \item Delay $\delta$\\
        The round-trip delay between the client and server. It is equal to the
        time that a massage travels from the client to the server and the time
        it comes back.
        % $$\delta_{AB} = \left(T_{i} - T_{i-3}\right) - \left(T_{i-1} -
        % T_{i-2}\right)$$
    \item Dispersion $\varepsilon$\\
        The maximum error inherent in the measurement.
        Another definition: Potential clock offset error due to the maximum
        uncorrected system clock frequency error.
        These definitions are in some respect confused, we will discuss it with
        more detail in section~\ref{sec:peer_processes}.

\section{Overview}%
\label{sec:overview}
Figure~\ref{fig:peer_poll_processes} shows the basic architecture of peer/poll
processes. The communication between client and server uses on-wire protocol,
which can provide sample statistics ($\theta_0, \delta_0, t_0$ in the figure).
The recent eight samples are stored in a shift register, with one more sample
statistic added ($\varepsilon$).  Then peer process applies clock filter
algorithm, which generates peer statistics ($\theta, \delta, \varepsilon$ in
the figure), and passes them to system process.

The purpose of peer processes is to communicate with servers and to keep
statistics of the communications which can be used to determine how reliable
the servers are. And for poll processes, their job is to manage the
communications to get sufficient data without making the servers too busy.

\section{On wire protocol}%
\label{sec:on_wire_protocol}
In NTP subnet, a client can send request to server and the server sends back
response after it got the request. The whole round of the communication can
generate a sample. For every sample, the client wants to know the difference
between the server's system clock and its, aka offset.
But it may take a while for the server to give the response. And it is not
predictable, as well as the network delay between the two devices.
In NTP subnet, clients and servers communicate under on-wire protocol. It
provides a smart way to calculate offset and delay for every sample. 

\subsection{Statistics calculation}%
\label{sub:statistics_calculation}
Figure~\ref{fig:on_wire1} represents the timestamps and communications between
a client and a server. The vertical dash line indicates the same time. The
arrow indicates the communication packages sent from one side and received at
the other side. The notation $T_i$ stands for the timestamp gotten from the
system clock of one device. 

\input{figures/on_wire1.tex}
% fig:on_wire1

In ideal situation, if we have $T_1$ and $T_0$, which are timestamps gotten from
both devices at the same time, then we can get the offset $\theta$:
$$\theta = T_1 - T_0$$
But we cannot do this since we cannot determine whether two timestamps were
token at the same time. The on-wire protocol actually calculates the offset in
an alternative way:
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2}\left[(T_3 - T_2) + (T_4 - T_5)\right]$$
Note that this equation is equivalent to:
$$\theta = \frac{T_3 + T_4}{2} - \frac{T_2 + T_5}{2}$$
which means that the offset is equal to the difference between two timestamps
which are the middle points of $T_3, T_4$ and $T_2, T_5$. 
If the network delay is symmetric, which means the time for
packages to travel from client to server and the time for packages to get back
are equal, the middle points are at the same time. In this case, it is
equivalent to the ideal situation. If the delay is asymmetric, there will be an
error of the calculation. This error is impossible to be corrected.  But there
is one scenario that the error can be attenuated.~\cite{redbook} We will
discuss this part in section~\ref{sub:huff_n_puff_filter}.

The delay $\delta$ is calculated by:
$$ \delta = (T_5 - T_2) - (T_4 - T_3)$$
It is actually a difference of two time periods. It is not impacted by the
offset, since each time period is calculated using two timestamps from the same
device.
